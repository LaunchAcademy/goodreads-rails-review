# Good Reads Rails

It turns out that we really love books. So much so that we want to catalogue which books are our favorite, and allow our friends to provide reviews on our very own website. 

# Setup 
```
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

This is a test driven assignment, so let the tests guide you. Make sure to read each test before running the test file in order to get a sense of what is expected of you. 

For the sake of time, this app priorities viewing books on a show page, and then adding reviews. However, you are encouraged to add your own book form to the app so that users can add new books!
